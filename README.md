# Project #4: Travel Explorer


## Overview 

The final project at GA was to create a full-stack web application. This two-person, week-long project utilised a Python Flask RESTful API.
TravelExplorer allows users to navigate the world, exploring new cities and find some new places and even suggest an itinerary for specified dates. User functionality allows the creation of travel wish-lists, and comments and reviews.
The idea was born out of a mutual love for travel and frustration with the lack of user interaction with travel websites, specifically as a place to plan a trip! 
You can find the project here.

## Brief

### Requirements

​* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Flask API** using a Flask REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **A working app** hosted on the internet
* **A link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* **A git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
